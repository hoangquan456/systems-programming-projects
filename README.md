# üß† System Programming Projects

## Overview
This repository showcases a collection of **low-level systems programming projects** written in **C and C++**, focused on building core components of operating systems ‚Äî from process management and interprocess communication (IPC) to memory hierarchy simulation and shell design.  
Each project demonstrates a different facet of **Unix/Linux system-level programming**, emphasizing mastery of **system calls**, **process control**, **signals**, and **resource management**.

These projects were completed as part of an intensive systems programming course and are designed to reflect **real-world engineering skills** ‚Äî from building reliable concurrent systems to simulating CPU behavior and cache architectures.

## üß† Projects Summary

### üßÆ Shell Simulator
**Goal:** Implement a minimal Unix shell (`tsh`) using system calls.  
**Highlights:**
- Executes commands via `fork()`, `execvp()`, and `wait()`.
- Implements command parsing, tokenization, and I/O redirection with `pipe()` and `dup2()`.
- Supports multi-command pipelines and graceful termination (`quit` command).
- Features a `DEBUGMODE` flag and GDB-compatible debugging setup.

üß∞ *Core Skills:* Process creation, IPC, shell design, memory management, testing.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Cache Simulator
**Goal:** Build a simulator to model CPU cache behavior and analyze memory access efficiency.  
**Highlights:**
- Implements cache allocation (`make_cache`, `make_sets`, `make_lines`).
- Uses bit extraction for cache indexing and tag identification.
- Designs an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction algorithm.
- Evaluates hit/miss ratios across various cache configurations and workloads.

üß∞ *Core Skills:* Memory management, data structure allocation, bitwise operations, LRU algorithms.


### üöÄ Simulated Parallel Processing
**Goal:** Simulate multi-core parallel processing using **processes, pipes, and signals**.  
**Highlights:**
- Main process coordinates three child processes acting as CPU cores.
- Two-way communication via pipes (`pipe()`), and result notification via real-time signals (`SIGRTMIN + i`).
- Uses atomic signal handling (`volatile sig_atomic_t`) for safe, non-blocking communication.
- Demonstrates real-time scheduling, task distribution, and concurrent result aggregation.

üß∞ *Core Skills:* Process synchronization, signal handling, IPC, concurrent task scheduling.

## üß™ What I Learned
- Designing modular, testable systems in **C/C++** with clear memory ownership and cleanup.
- Handling **concurrent processes** and **asynchronous signals** safely.
- Implementing **low-level communication primitives** for coordination between processes.
- Debugging and profiling performance-critical C programs.

## üöÄ Takeaway
This repository represents a complete journey through **systems-level software engineering** ‚Äî from memory simulation and concurrency to shell implementation.  
Each project mirrors **real operating system mechanisms**, built entirely from scratch without external libraries beyond standard POSIX calls.

By mastering these projects, I‚Äôve developed the foundation for building **robust, performant, and low-level software systems** that interact directly with the operating system.
